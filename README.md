## How to run experiments

### 1. Requirements

Please note that the installation of the D4RL environments and CALVIN benchmark are not included in `requirements.txt`.  
We recommend you to install the D4RL environments from [D4RL repo](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/D4RL),
and CALVIN benchmark from [CALVIN repo](https://github.com/mees/calvin).  
We also note that we utilize dataset provided by [TACO-RL repo](https://github.com/ErickRosete/tacorl) for CALVIN experiments,
which has slightly different training/validation split.
